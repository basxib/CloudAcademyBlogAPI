I used the test driven development approach aka (TDD) to build this sample project.

# Installation & testing instructions (Windows):

2. Make sure you have .net 5 installed from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0
3. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal: "CD:\Path_To_Project_Folder"
4. To build the project type "dotnet build"
5. To run all unit tests type "dotnet test"
6. To run the project CD:\WebApi\ then type "dotnet run"
7. The web server should be running on port 8090 now.
